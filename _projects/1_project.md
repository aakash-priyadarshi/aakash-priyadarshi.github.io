## Overview

This project developed a customized Q&A web application using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo, combined with Pinecone vector search technology, for enhanced domain-specific data retrieval and user interaction.

The system integrates models like DistilBERT and Facebook/BART for context-aware responses and semantic tagging, ensuring precision and relevance. It features a dynamic user interface, backend scalability, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for real-time, context-driven answers.
